If you use Gmail with 2-Step Verification, you'll need to create an **App Password** instead of your actual password.

Steps:
1. Visit [https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
2. Select **Mail** as the app and **Other** as the device.
3. Copy the generated 16-character password.
4. Paste it into GitHub as the value for `EMAIL_PASS`.
